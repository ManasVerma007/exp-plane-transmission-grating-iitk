Diffraction grating is a thin film of clear glass or plastic that has a large number of lines per (mm) drawn on it. A typical grating has density of 250 lines/mm. Using more expensive laser techniques, it is possible to create line densities of 3000 lines/mm or higher. When light from a bright and small source passes through a diffraction grating, it generates a large number of sources at the grating. The very thin space between every two adjacent lines of the grating becomes an independent source. These sources are coherent sources meaning that they emit in phase waves with the same wavelength. These sources act independently such that each source sends out waves in all directions. As shown in Fig. 1, on a screen a distance D away, points can be found whose distance differences from these sources are different multiples of λ causing bright fringes. One difference between the interference of many slits (diffraction grating) and double slit experiment is that a diffraction grating makes a number of principle maxima along with lower intensity maxima in between. The principal maxima occur on both sides of the central maximum for which a formula similar to double slit interference holds true which is given by <br><br>

In this equation, d is the spacing between every two lines (same as every two sources). If there are N lines per mm of the grating, then d, the space between every two adjacent lines or (every two adjacent sources) is d=1/N(mm)
Based on Eq. 1, if the light source has different colors (different wavelengths), shorter wavelength color will have smaller diffraction angle compared to longer wavelength for the same order of principle maximum. Thus we will see a spectrum in such case. The angular spacing for different colors will increase for higher order maxima.
